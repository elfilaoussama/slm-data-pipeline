# Platform notes

This project uses standard Python and Docker tooling and should run on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

General guidance:
- Ensure Docker CLI is available if you want security scans.
- Use a Python 3.10â€“3.12 virtual environment.
- If on Windows, use either native Python or your preferred POSIX layer; steps are the same.

For step-by-step instructions, see `QUICKSTART.md` and `docs/troubleshooting.md`.
